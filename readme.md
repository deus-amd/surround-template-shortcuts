# Live Template Shortcuts for ReSharper

This plugin for ReSharper creates additional shortcuts to activate LiveTemplate Surround templates.

Surround templates in ReSharper can be assigned a "mnemonic" number, which is normally only used in the Surround dropdown-menu (Ctrl-E + U). This plugin adds shortcuts to activate the Surround templates directly by their mnemonic number, on the current selected text.

Due to ReSharper plugin limitations, the shorcut bindings must be activated (one-time) from the button in the ReSharper -> Tools menu. The shortcuts are by default Ctrl-1 to Ctrl-0 and can afterwards be changed from the Visual Studio keyboard options.
